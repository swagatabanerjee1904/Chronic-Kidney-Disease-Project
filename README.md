# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Project
In this project, I analyze a dataset to predict chronic kidney disease.

First of all, I download a dataset on chronic kidney disease and then applying various algorithms of Machine Learning to predict whether a patient is having chronic kidney disease or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
