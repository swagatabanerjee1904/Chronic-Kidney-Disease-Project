# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Project
In this project, I analyze a dataset to predict chronic kidney disease.

First of all, I download a dataset on chronic kidney disease and then applying various algorithms of Machine Learning to predict whether a patient is having chronic kidney disease or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

About Dataset This dataset is originally from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient is having chronic kidney disease or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Content The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Class. Predictor variables includes Blood Pressure(Bp), Albumin(Al), etc. I download this dataset from Kaggle. Some steps which were done:

IMPORTING LIBRARIES: Started by importing the necessary libraries for the project, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. These libraries will be used to perform data reading, cleaning, analysis and visualization.

READING DATA: Read the data set of Chronic Heart disease into a pandas dataframe. Making sure to handle any missing values or errors in the data while reading.

DATA PREPROCESSING: Perform necessary preprocessing on the data to make it ready for analysis. This may include removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting data types, and cleaning up the data.

EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: Performing exploratory analysis on the data to get an understanding of the data distribution, patterns, and relationships. Use descriptive statistics and plots to summarize the data and identify any trends.

DATA VISUALIZATION: Visualize the data to make it more meaningful and presentable. Used bar graph and pie chart to illustrate patterns and relationships in the data.

7.Heatmap Data Correlation

8.Machine Learnng Model building:

I build a machine learning model here and then apply various algorithm to check the accuracy of the model.

I apply Logistic Regression, KNN Algorithm, AdaBoost and Random Forest Algorithm.
